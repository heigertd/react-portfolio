        con1: 'I am a Seattle-based web developer. I started web development after a friend of mine showed me a web site he had built by himself. The process intrigued me and I started teaching myself some basic coding with some help from some friends. Eventually I decided I needed some more structured training and eventually recieved my full-stack certification through the University of Washington. Since then I have been learning and practicing new skills.',
